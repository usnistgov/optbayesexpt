Version Notes
=============

Version 1.1.0
-------------

May 11, 2021

Plans for version 1.1.0

* Add transparent support for multi-channel measurements. Examples might be
  X, Y outputs from lockin amplifiers, IQ mixer channels, or multiple photon
  counters.

* Accelerate computation-heavy functions using numba on systems where the
  numba package is installed.

* Add keyword arguments to OptBayesExpt() class

  - noiseparam (``int``): Provides an index into the parameters array,
    identifying the parameter
    as an uncertainty to be determined alongside the model_function
    parameters. If ``noiseparam is not None``, likelihood calculations use
    this parameter instead of uncertainties provided with measurement values.
    Default ``None``.

  - scale (``boolean``): In particle resampling, ``scale=True`` compensates
    for a small, distribution-broadening, random-walk step by shrinking the
    distribution towards its mean. This scaling preserves the standard
    deviation of Gaussian distributions under resampling, but distorts
    non-Gaussian distributions.  Default is ``scale=True`` for backward
    compatibility, but ``scale=False`` is recommended.

  - choke (``float``): Occasionally, simulated measurement runs will "get
    stuck," and converge to incorrect parameter values. The ``choke`` argument
    provides a heuristic fix for better reliability at the expense of speed.
    For ``0.0 < choke < 1.0``, the likelihood is raised to the ``choke`` power.
    This change reduces the max/min ratio of the likelihood and allows more
    data to influence the parameter distribution between resampling events.
    Default ``choke=1.0``.

Version 1.0.1

June 2, 2020

* Provides backwards compatibility to numpy.random usage for numpy versions pre-1.17.0.

* Fixes some plotting problems

* Adds 'ready' command to OBE_Server.run() for communication checks.

Version 1.0.0
-------------

April 27, 2020

Version 1.0.0 represents an overhaul of the optbayesexpt python package.  It
is not compatible with earlier versions, but only minor changes are needed to
adapt script to use the new version.
The most significant changes are briefly described here. Please consult the
documentation at https://pages.nist.gov/optbayesexpt for more detail.

Probability Distribution Function:
    Starting with V.1.0.0, the probability distribution function over
    parameter values is implemented using a sequential
    Monte Carlo scheme in ``ParticlePDF()``, replacing the
    N-dimensional array representation used in ``ProbDistFunc()``. This
    change boosts speed and allows more parameters in the model function.

Experiment Model:
    Starting with V.1.0.0, the ``ExptModel`` class is no longer used. Methods
    of the ``ExptModel`` class are incorporated into ``OptBayesExpt``.

OptBayesExpt class:
    The OptBayesExpt class has been rewritten with reuse in mind.
    As much as possible, the calculations have been split out into separate
    methods.  The goal was to make is easier to determine how to create
    customized child classes for different applications.

    Creation of a functioning ``OptBayesExpt`` object has been simplified
    by including the model function, settings, parameters and constants as
    arguments to ``__init__()``.  In earlier versions, the object was created
    and then configured in separate steps.

Server:
    The ``OBE_Server class`` has been redesigned to be a caretaker and TCP
    communication interface for OptBayesExpt objects.  With this new design
    a OBE_Server object can initialize a series of OptBayesExpt objects
    with different configurations, e.g. for a series of measurement runs.
